            <p class="calibre4">
                Go does not provide the typical, type-driven notion of subclassing,
                but it does have the ability to “borrow” pieces of an
                implementation by <em class="calibre12">embedding</em> types within a struct or
                interface.
            </p>
            <p class="calibre4">
                Interface embedding is very simple.
                We've mentioned the <code class="calibre6">io.Reader</code> and <code class="calibre6">io.Writer</code>
                interfaces before;
                here are their definitions.
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type Writer interface {
    Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                The <code class="calibre6">io</code> package also exports several other interfaces
                that specify objects that can implement several such methods.
                For instance, there is <code class="calibre6">io.ReadWriter</code>, an interface
                containing both <code class="calibre6">Read</code> and <code class="calibre6">Write</code>.
                We could specify <code class="calibre6">io.ReadWriter</code> by listing the
                two methods explicitly, but it's easier and more evocative
                to embed the two interfaces to form the new one, like this:
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">// ReadWriter is the interface that combines the Reader and Writer interfaces.
type ReadWriter interface {
    Reader
    Writer
}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                This says just what it looks like: A <code class="calibre6">ReadWriter</code> can do
                what a <code class="calibre6">Reader</code> does <em class="calibre12">and</em> what a <code
                    class="calibre6">Writer</code>
                does; it is a union of the embedded interfaces.
                Only interfaces can be embedded within interfaces.
            </p>
            <p class="calibre4">
                The same basic idea applies to structs, but with more far-reaching
                implications. The <code class="calibre6">bufio</code> package has two struct types,
                <code class="calibre6">bufio.Reader</code> and <code class="calibre6">bufio.Writer</code>, each of
                which of course implements the analogous interfaces from package
                <code class="calibre6">io</code>.
                And <code class="calibre6">bufio</code> also implements a buffered reader/writer,
                which it does by combining a reader and a writer into one struct
                using embedding: it lists the types within the struct
                but does not give them field names.
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">// ReadWriter stores pointers to a Reader and a Writer.
// It implements io.ReadWriter.
type ReadWriter struct {
    *Reader  // *bufio.Reader
    *Writer  // *bufio.Writer
}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                The embedded elements are pointers to structs and of course
                must be initialized to point to valid structs before they
                can be used.
                The <code class="calibre6">ReadWriter</code> struct could be written as
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">type ReadWriter struct {
    reader *Reader
    writer *Writer
}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                but then to promote the methods of the fields and to
                satisfy the <code class="calibre6">io</code> interfaces, we would also need
                to provide forwarding methods, like this:
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">func (rw *ReadWriter) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
    return rw.reader.Read(p)
}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                By embedding the structs directly, we avoid this bookkeeping.
                The methods of embedded types come along for free, which means that <code
                    class="calibre6">bufio.ReadWriter</code>
                not only has the methods of <code class="calibre6">bufio.Reader</code> and <code
                    class="calibre6">bufio.Writer</code>,
                it also satisfies all three interfaces:
                <code class="calibre6">io.Reader</code>,
                <code class="calibre6">io.Writer</code>, and
                <code class="calibre6">io.ReadWriter</code>.
            </p>
            <p class="calibre4">
                There's an important way in which embedding differs from subclassing. When we embed a type,
                the methods of that type become methods of the outer type,
                but when they are invoked the receiver of the method is the inner type, not the outer one.
                In our example, when the <code class="calibre6">Read</code> method of a <code
                    class="calibre6">bufio.ReadWriter</code> is
                invoked, it has exactly the same effect as the forwarding method written out above;
                the receiver is the <code class="calibre6">reader</code> field of the <code
                    class="calibre6">ReadWriter</code>, not the
                <code class="calibre6">ReadWriter</code> itself.
            </p>
            <p class="calibre4">
                Embedding can also be a simple convenience.
                This example shows an embedded field alongside a regular, named field.
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">type Job struct {
    Command string
    *log.Logger
}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                The <code class="calibre6">Job</code> type now has the <code class="calibre6">Print</code>, <code
                    class="calibre6">Printf</code>, <code class="calibre6">Println</code>
                and other
                methods of <code class="calibre6">*log.Logger</code>. We could have given the <code
                    class="calibre6">Logger</code>
                a field name, of course, but it's not necessary to do so. And now, once
                initialized, we can
                log to the <code class="calibre6">Job</code>:
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">job.Println("starting now...")
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                The <code class="calibre6">Logger</code> is a regular field of the <code class="calibre6">Job</code>
                struct,
                so we can initialize it in the usual way inside the constructor for <code class="calibre6">Job</code>,
                like this,
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">func NewJob(command string, logger *log.Logger) *Job {
    return &amp;Job{command, logger}
}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                or with a composite literal,
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">job := &amp;Job{command, log.New(os.Stderr, "Job: ", log.Ldate)}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                If we need to refer to an embedded field directly, the type name of the field,
                ignoring the package qualifier, serves as a field name, as it did
                in the <code class="calibre6">Read</code> method of our <code class="calibre6">ReadWriter</code> struct.
                Here, if we needed to access the
                <code class="calibre6">*log.Logger</code> of a <code class="calibre6">Job</code> variable <code
                    class="calibre6">job</code>,
                we would write <code class="calibre6">job.Logger</code>,
                which would be useful if we wanted to refine the methods of <code class="calibre6">Logger</code>.
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">func (job *Job) Printf(format string, args ...interface{}) {
    job.Logger.Printf("%q: %s", job.Command, fmt.Sprintf(format, args...))
}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                Embedding types introduces the problem of name conflicts but the rules to resolve
                them are simple.
                First, a field or method <code class="calibre6">X</code> hides any other item <code
                    class="calibre6">X</code> in a more deeply
                nested part of the type.
                If <code class="calibre6">log.Logger</code> contained a field or method called <code
                    class="calibre6">Command</code>, the <code class="calibre6">Command</code> field
                of <code class="calibre6">Job</code> would dominate it.
            </p>
            <p class="calibre4">
                Second, if the same name appears at the same nesting level, it is usually an error;
                it would be erroneous to embed <code class="calibre6">log.Logger</code> if the <code
                    class="calibre6">Job</code> struct
                contained another field or method called <code class="calibre6">Logger</code>.
                However, if the duplicate name is never mentioned in the program outside the type definition, it is OK.
                This qualification provides some protection against changes made to types embedded from outside; there
                is no problem if a field is added that conflicts with another field in another subtype if neither field
                is ever used.
            </p>
