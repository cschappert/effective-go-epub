          <p class="calibre4">
          Go is a new language.  Although it borrows ideas from
          existing languages,
          it has unusual properties that make effective Go programs
          different in character from programs written in its relatives.
          A straightforward translation of a C++ or Java program into Go
          is unlikely to produce a satisfactory resultâ€”Java programs
          are written in Java, not Go.
          On the other hand, thinking about the problem from a Go
          perspective could produce a successful but quite different
          program.
          In other words,
          to write Go well, it's important to understand its properties
          and idioms.
          It's also important to know the established conventions for
          programming in Go, such as naming, formatting, program
          construction, and so on, so that programs you write
          will be easy for other Go programmers to understand.

          This document gives tips for writing clear, idiomatic Go code.
          It augments the <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec" class="pcalibre calibre">language specification</a>,
          the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/" class="pcalibre calibre">Tour of Go</a>,
          and <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html" class="pcalibre calibre">How to Write Go Code</a>,
          all of which you
          should read first.

            The <a href="https://golang.org/src/" class="pcalibre calibre">Go package sources</a>
            are intended to serve not
            only as the core library but also as examples of how to
            use the language.
            Moreover, many of the packages contain working, self-contained
            executable examples you can run directly from the
            <a href="https://golang.org/" class="pcalibre calibre">golang.org</a> web site, such as
            <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#example_Map" class="pcalibre calibre">this one</a> (if
            necessary, click on the word "Example" to open it up).
            If you have a question about how to approach a problem or how something
            might be implemented, the documentation, code and examples in the
            library can provide answers, ideas and
            background.
