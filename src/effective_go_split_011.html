      <p class="calibre4">
        As we saw with <code class="calibre6">ByteSize</code>,
        methods can be defined for any named type (except a pointer or an interface);
        the receiver does not have to be a struct.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre4">
        In the discussion of slices above, we wrote an <code class="calibre6">Append</code>
        function. We can define it as a method on slices instead. To do
        this, we first declare a named type to which we can bind the method, and
        then make the receiver for the method a value of that type.
      </p>
      <pre class="calibre7">type ByteSlice []byte

func (slice ByteSlice) Append(data []byte) []byte {
    // Body exactly the same as the Append function defined above.
}
</pre>
      <p class="calibre4">
        This still requires the method to return the updated slice. We can
        eliminate that clumsiness by redefining the method to take a
        <i class="calibre12">pointer</i> to a <code class="calibre6">ByteSlice</code> as its receiver, so the
        method can overwrite the caller's slice.
      </p>
      <pre class="calibre7">func (p *ByteSlice) Append(data []byte) {
    slice := *p
    // Body as above, without the return.
    *p = slice
}
</pre>
      <p class="calibre4">
        In fact, we can do even better. If we modify our function so it looks
        like a standard <code class="calibre6">Write</code> method, like this,
      </p>
      <pre class="calibre7">func (p *ByteSlice) Write(data []byte) (n int, err error) {
    slice := *p
    // Again as above.
    *p = slice
    return len(data), nil
}
</pre>
      <p class="calibre4">
        then the type <code class="calibre6">*ByteSlice</code> satisfies the standard interface
        <code class="calibre6">io.Writer</code>, which is handy. For instance, we can
        print into one.
      </p>
      <pre class="calibre7">    var b ByteSlice
    fmt.Fprintf(&amp;b, "This hour has %d days\n", 7)
</pre>
      <p class="calibre4">
        We pass the address of a <code class="calibre6">ByteSlice</code>
        because only <code class="calibre6">*ByteSlice</code> satisfies <code class="calibre6">io.Writer</code>.
        The rule about pointers vs. values for receivers is that value methods
        can be invoked on pointers and values, but pointer methods can only be
        invoked on pointers.
      </p>

      <p class="calibre4">
        This rule arises because pointer methods can modify the receiver; invoking
        them on a value would cause the method to receive a copy of the value, so
        any modifications would be discarded.
        The language therefore disallows this mistake.
        There is a handy exception, though. When the value is addressable, the
        language takes care of the common case of invoking a pointer method on a
        value by inserting the address operator automatically.
        In our example, the variable <code class="calibre6">b</code> is addressable, so we can call
        its <code class="calibre6">Write</code> method with just <code class="calibre6">b.Write</code>. The compiler
        will rewrite that to <code class="calibre6">(&amp;b).Write</code> for us.
      </p>

      <p class="calibre4">
        By the way, the idea of using <code class="calibre6">Write</code> on a slice of bytes
        is central to the implementation of <code class="calibre6">bytes.Buffer</code>.
      </p>
