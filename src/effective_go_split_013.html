            <h2 id="blank" class="calibre3">The blank identifier</h2>

            <p class="calibre4">
                We've mentioned the blank identifier a couple of times now, in the context of
                <a href="effective_go_split_007.html#for" class="pcalibre calibre"><code class="calibre6">for</code>
                    <code class="calibre6">range</code> loops</a>
                and <a href="effective_go_split_009.html#maps" class="pcalibre calibre">maps</a>.
                The blank identifier can be assigned or declared with any value of any type, with the
                value discarded harmlessly.
                It's a bit like writing to the Unix <code class="calibre6">/dev/null</code> file:
                it represents a write-only value
                to be used as a place-holder
                where a variable is needed but the actual value is irrelevant.
                It has uses beyond those we've seen already.
            </p>

            <h3 id="blank_assign" class="calibre5">The blank identifier in multiple assignment</h3>

            <p class="calibre4">
                The use of a blank identifier in a <code class="calibre6">for</code> <code class="calibre6">range</code>
                loop is a
                special case of a general situation: multiple assignment.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                If an assignment requires multiple values on the left side,
                but one of the values will not be used by the program,
                a blank identifier on the left-hand-side of
                the assignment avoids the need
                to create a dummy variable and makes it clear that the
                value is to be discarded.
                For instance, when calling a function that returns
                a value and an error, but only the error is important,
                use the blank identifier to discard the irrelevant value.
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">if _, err := os.Stat(path); os.IsNotExist(err) {
	fmt.Printf("%s does not exist\n", path)
}
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                Occasionally you'll see code that discards the error value in order
                to ignore the error; this is terrible practice. Always check error returns;
                they're provided for a reason.
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">// Bad! This code will crash if path does not exist.
fi, _ := os.Stat(path)
if fi.IsDir() {
    fmt.Printf("%s is a directory\n", path)
}
</pre>

            <h3 id="blank_unused" class="calibre5">Unused imports and variables</h3>

            <p class="calibre4">
                It is an error to import a package or to declare a variable without using it.
                Unused imports bloat the program and slow compilation,
                while a variable that is initialized but not used is at least
                a wasted computation and perhaps indicative of a
                larger bug.
                When a program is under active development, however,
                unused imports and variables often arise and it can
                be annoying to delete them just to have the compilation proceed,
                only to have them be needed again later.
                The blank identifier provides a workaround.
            </p>
            <p class="calibre4">
                This half-written program has two unused imports
                (<code class="calibre6">fmt</code> and <code class="calibre6">io</code>)
                and an unused variable (<code class="calibre6">fd</code>),
                so it will not compile, but it would be nice to see if the
                code so far is correct.
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7"><!--{{code "/doc/progs/eff_unused1.go" `/package/` "$"}}
-->package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    fd, err := os.Open("test.go")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    <span class="comment">// TODO: use fd.</span>
}</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                To silence complaints about the unused imports, use a
                blank identifier to refer to a symbol from the imported package.
                Similarly, assigning the unused variable <code class="calibre6">fd</code>
                to the blank identifier will silence the unused variable error.
                This version of the program does compile.
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7"><!--{{code "/doc/progs/eff_unused2.go" `/package/` "$"}}
-->package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "log"
    "os"
)

var _ = fmt.Printf <span class="comment">// For debugging; delete when done.</span>
var _ io.Reader    <span class="comment">// For debugging; delete when done.</span>

func main() {
    fd, err := os.Open("test.go")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    <span class="comment">// TODO: use fd.</span>
    _ = fd
}</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                By convention, the global declarations to silence import errors
                should come right after the imports and be commented,
                both to make them easy to find and as a reminder to clean things up later.
            </p>

            <h3 id="blank_import" class="calibre5">Import for side effect</h3>

            <p class="calibre4">
                An unused import like <code class="calibre6">fmt</code> or <code class="calibre6">io</code> in the
                previous example should eventually be used or removed:
                blank assignments identify code as a work in progress.
                But sometimes it is useful to import a package only for its
                side effects, without any explicit use.
                For example, during its <code class="calibre6">init</code> function,
                the <code
                    class="calibre6"><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/" class="pcalibre calibre">net/http/pprof</a></code>
                package registers HTTP handlers that provide
                debugging information. It has an exported API, but
                most clients need only the handler registration and
                access the data through a web page.
                To import the package only for its side effects, rename the package
                to the blank identifier:
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">import _ "net/http/pprof"
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                This form of import makes clear that the package is being
                imported for its side effects, because there is no other possible
                use of the package: in this file, it doesn't have a name.
                (If it did, and we didn't use that name, the compiler would reject the program.)
            </p>

            <h3 id="blank_implements" class="calibre5">Interface checks</h3>

            <p class="calibre4">
                As we saw in the discussion of <a href="effective_go_split_012.html#interfaces_and_types"
                    class="pcalibre calibre">interfaces</a> above,
                a type need not declare explicitly that it implements an interface.
                Instead, a type implements the interface just by implementing the interface's methods.
                In practice, most interface conversions are static and therefore checked at compile time.
                For example, passing an <code class="calibre6">*os.File</code> to a function
                expecting an <code class="calibre6">io.Reader</code> will not compile unless
                <code class="calibre6">*os.File</code> implements the <code class="calibre6">io.Reader</code> interface.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                Some interface checks do happen at run-time, though.
                One instance is in the <code
                    class="calibre6"><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/" class="pcalibre calibre">encoding/json</a></code>
                package, which defines a <code
                    class="calibre6"><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshaler" class="pcalibre calibre">Marshaler</a></code>
                interface. When the JSON encoder receives a value that implements that interface,
                the encoder invokes the value's marshaling method to convert it to JSON
                instead of doing the standard conversion.
                The encoder checks this property at run time with a <a
                    href="effective_go_split_012.html#interface_conversions" class="pcalibre calibre">type assertion</a>
                like:
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">m, ok := val.(json.Marshaler)
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                If it's necessary only to ask whether a type implements an interface, without
                actually using the interface itself, perhaps as part of an error check, use the blank
                identifier to ignore the type-asserted value:
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">if _, ok := val.(json.Marshaler); ok {
    fmt.Printf("value %v of type %T implements json.Marshaler\n", val, val)
}
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                One place this situation arises is when it is necessary to guarantee within the package implementing the
                type that
                it actually satisfies the interface.
                If a type—for example,
                <code
                    class="calibre6"><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#RawMessage" class="pcalibre calibre">json.RawMessage</a></code>—needs
                a custom JSON representation, it should implement
                <code class="calibre6">json.Marshaler</code>, but there are no static conversions that would
                cause the compiler to verify this automatically.
                If the type inadvertently fails to satisfy the interface, the JSON encoder will still work,
                but will not use the custom implementation.
                To guarantee that the implementation is correct,
                a global declaration using the blank identifier can be used in the package:
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">var _ json.Marshaler = (*RawMessage)(nil)
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                In this declaration, the assignment involving a conversion of a
                <code class="calibre6">*RawMessage</code> to a <code class="calibre6">Marshaler</code>
                requires that <code class="calibre6">*RawMessage</code> implements <code
                    class="calibre6">Marshaler</code>,
                and that property will be checked at compile time.
                Should the <code class="calibre6">json.Marshaler</code> interface change, this package
                will no longer compile and we will be on notice that it needs to be updated.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                The appearance of the blank identifier in this construct indicates that
                the declaration exists only for the type checking,
                not to create a variable.
                Don't do this for every type that satisfies an interface, though.
                By convention, such declarations are only used
                when there are no static conversions already present in the code,
                which is a rare event.
            </p>
