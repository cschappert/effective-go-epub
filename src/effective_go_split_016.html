            <p class="calibre4">
                Library routines must often return some sort of error indication to
                the caller.
                As mentioned earlier, Go's multivalue return makes it
                easy to return a detailed error description alongside the normal
                return value.
                It is good style to use this feature to provide detailed error information.
                For example, as we'll see, <code class="calibre6">os.Open</code> doesn't
                just return a <code class="calibre6">nil</code> pointer on failure, it also returns an
                error value that describes what went wrong.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                By convention, errors have type <code class="calibre6">error</code>,
                a simple built-in interface.
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">type error interface {
    Error() string
}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                A library writer is free to implement this interface with a
                richer model under the covers, making it possible not only
                to see the error but also to provide some context.
                As mentioned, alongside the usual <code class="calibre6">*os.File</code>
                return value, <code class="calibre6">os.Open</code> also returns an
                error value.
                If the file is opened successfully, the error will be <code class="calibre6">nil</code>,
                but when there is a problem, it will hold an
                <code class="calibre6">os.PathError</code>:
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">// PathError records an error and the operation and
// file path that caused it.
type PathError struct {
    Op string    // "open", "unlink", etc.
    Path string  // The associated file.
    Err error    // Returned by the system call.
}

func (e *PathError) Error() string {
    return e.Op + " " + e.Path + ": " + e.Err.Error()
}
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                <code class="calibre6">PathError</code>'s <code class="calibre6">Error</code> generates
                a string like this:
            </p>
            <pre class="calibre7">open /etc/passwx: no such file or directory
</pre>
            <p class="calibre4">
                Such an error, which includes the problematic file name, the
                operation, and the operating system error it triggered, is useful even
                if printed far from the call that caused it;
                it is much more informative than the plain
                "no such file or directory".
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                When feasible, error strings should identify their origin, such as by having
                a prefix naming the operation or package that generated the error. For example, in package
                <code class="calibre6">image</code>, the string representation for a decoding error due to an
                unknown format is "image: unknown format".
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                Callers that care about the precise error details can
                use a type switch or a type assertion to look for specific
                errors and extract details. For <code class="calibre6">PathErrors</code>
                this might include examining the internal <code class="calibre6">Err</code>
                field for recoverable failures.
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">for try := 0; try &lt; 2; try++ {
    file, err = os.Create(filename)
    if err == nil {
        return
    }
    if e, ok := err.(*os.PathError); ok &amp;&amp; e.Err == syscall.ENOSPC {
        deleteTempFiles()  // Recover some space.
        continue
    }
    return
}
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                The second <code class="calibre6">if</code> statement here is another <a
                    href="effective_go_split_012.html#interface_conversions" class="pcalibre calibre">type
                    assertion</a>.
                If it fails, <code class="calibre6">ok</code> will be false, and <code class="calibre6">e</code>
                will be <code class="calibre6">nil</code>.
                If it succeeds, <code class="calibre6">ok</code> will be true, which means the
                error was of type <code class="calibre6">*os.PathError</code>, and then so is <code
                    class="calibre6">e</code>,
                which we can examine for more information about the error.
            </p>

            <h3 id="panic" class="calibre5">Panic</h3>

            <p class="calibre4">
                The usual way to report an error to a caller is to return an
                <code class="calibre6">error</code> as an extra return value. The canonical
                <code class="calibre6">Read</code> method is a well-known instance; it returns a byte
                count and an <code class="calibre6">error</code>. But what if the error is
                unrecoverable? Sometimes the program simply cannot continue.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                For this purpose, there is a built-in function <code class="calibre6">panic</code>
                that in effect creates a run-time error that will stop the program
                (but see the next section). The function takes a single argument
                of arbitrary type—often a string—to be printed as the
                program dies. It's also a way to indicate that something impossible has
                happened, such as exiting an infinite loop.
            </p>


            <pre class="calibre7">// A toy implementation of cube root using Newton's method.
func CubeRoot(x float64) float64 {
    z := x/3   // Arbitrary initial value
    for i := 0; i &lt; 1e6; i++ {
        prevz := z
        z -= (z*z*z-x) / (3*z*z)
        if veryClose(z, prevz) {
            return z
        }
    }
    // A million iterations has not converged; something is wrong.
    panic(fmt.Sprintf("CubeRoot(%g) did not converge", x))
}
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                This is only an example but real library functions should
                avoid <code class="calibre6">panic</code>. If the problem can be masked or worked
                around, it's always better to let things continue to run rather
                than taking down the whole program. One possible counterexample
                is during initialization: if the library truly cannot set itself up,
                it might be reasonable to panic, so to speak.
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">var user = os.Getenv("USER")

func init() {
    if user == "" {
        panic("no value for $USER")
    }
}
</pre>

            <h3 id="recover" class="calibre5">Recover</h3>

            <p class="calibre4">
                When <code class="calibre6">panic</code> is called, including implicitly for run-time
                errors such as indexing a slice out of bounds or failing a type
                assertion, it immediately stops execution of the current function
                and begins unwinding the stack of the goroutine, running any deferred
                functions along the way. If that unwinding reaches the top of the
                goroutine's stack, the program dies. However, it is possible to
                use the built-in function <code class="calibre6">recover</code> to regain control
                of the goroutine and resume normal execution.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                A call to <code class="calibre6">recover</code> stops the unwinding and returns the
                argument passed to <code class="calibre6">panic</code>. Because the only code that
                runs while unwinding is inside deferred functions, <code class="calibre6">recover</code>
                is only useful inside deferred functions.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                One application of <code class="calibre6">recover</code> is to shut down a failing goroutine
                inside a server without killing the other executing goroutines.
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">func server(workChan &lt;-chan *Work) {
    for work := range workChan {
        go safelyDo(work)
    }
}

func safelyDo(work *Work) {
    defer func() {
        if err := recover(); err != nil {
            log.Println("work failed:", err)
        }
    }()
    do(work)
}
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                In this example, if <code class="calibre6">do(work)</code> panics, the result will be
                logged and the goroutine will exit cleanly without disturbing the
                others. There's no need to do anything else in the deferred closure;
                calling <code class="calibre6">recover</code> handles the condition completely.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                Because <code class="calibre6">recover</code> always returns <code class="calibre6">nil</code> unless
                called directly
                from a deferred function, deferred code can call library routines that themselves
                use <code class="calibre6">panic</code> and <code class="calibre6">recover</code> without failing. As an
                example,
                the deferred function in <code class="calibre6">safelyDo</code> might call a logging function before
                calling <code class="calibre6">recover</code>, and that logging code would run unaffected
                by the panicking state.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                With our recovery pattern in place, the <code class="calibre6">do</code>
                function (and anything it calls) can get out of any bad situation
                cleanly by calling <code class="calibre6">panic</code>. We can use that idea to
                simplify error handling in complex software. Let's look at an
                idealized version of a <code class="calibre6">regexp</code> package, which reports
                parsing errors by calling <code class="calibre6">panic</code> with a local
                error type. Here's the definition of <code class="calibre6">Error</code>,
                an <code class="calibre6">error</code> method, and the <code class="calibre6">Compile</code> function.
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">// Error is the type of a parse error; it satisfies the error interface.
type Error string
func (e Error) Error() string {
    return string(e)
}

// error is a method of *Regexp that reports parsing errors by
// panicking with an Error.
func (regexp *Regexp) error(err string) {
    panic(Error(err))
}

// Compile returns a parsed representation of the regular expression.
func Compile(str string) (regexp *Regexp, err error) {
    regexp = new(Regexp)
    // doParse will panic if there is a parse error.
    defer func() {
        if e := recover(); e != nil {
            regexp = nil    // Clear return value.
            err = e.(Error) // Will re-panic if not a parse error.
        }
    }()
    return regexp.doParse(str), nil
}
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                If <code class="calibre6">doParse</code> panics, the recovery block will set the
                return value to <code class="calibre6">nil</code>—deferred functions can modify
                named return values. It will then check, in the assignment
                to <code class="calibre6">err</code>, that the problem was a parse error by asserting
                that it has the local type <code class="calibre6">Error</code>.
                If it does not, the type assertion will fail, causing a run-time error
                that continues the stack unwinding as though nothing had interrupted
                it.
                This check means that if something unexpected happens, such
                as an index out of bounds, the code will fail even though we
                are using <code class="calibre6">panic</code> and <code class="calibre6">recover</code> to handle
                parse errors.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                With error handling in place, the <code class="calibre6">error</code> method (because it's a
                method bound to a type, it's fine, even natural, for it to have the same name
                as the builtin <code class="calibre6">error</code> type)
                makes it easy to report parse errors without worrying about unwinding
                the parse stack by hand:
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">if pos == 0 {
    re.error("'*' illegal at start of expression")
}
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                Useful though this pattern is, it should be used only within a package.
                <code class="calibre6">Parse</code> turns its internal <code class="calibre6">panic</code> calls into
                <code class="calibre6">error</code> values; it does not expose <code class="calibre6">panics</code>
                to its client. That is a good rule to follow.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                By the way, this re-panic idiom changes the panic value if an actual
                error occurs. However, both the original and new failures will be
                presented in the crash report, so the root cause of the problem will
                still be visible. Thus this simple re-panic approach is usually
                sufficient—it's a crash after all—but if you want to
                display only the original value, you can write a little more code to
                filter unexpected problems and re-panic with the original error.
                That's left as an exercise for the reader.
