      <p class="calibre4">
        Names are as important in Go as in any other language.
        They even have semantic effect:
        the visibility of a name outside a package is determined by whether its
        first character is upper case.
        It's therefore worth spending a little time talking about naming conventions
        in Go programs.
      </p>


      <h3 id="package-names" class="calibre5">Package names</h3>

      <p class="calibre4">
        When a package is imported, the package name becomes an accessor for the
        contents. After
      </p>

      <pre class="calibre7">import "bytes"
</pre>

      <p class="calibre4">
        the importing package can talk about <code class="calibre6">bytes.Buffer</code>. It's
        helpful if everyone using the package can use the same name to refer to
        its contents, which implies that the package name should be good:
        short, concise, evocative. By convention, packages are given
        lower case, single-word names; there should be no need for underscores
        or mixedCaps.
        Err on the side of brevity, since everyone using your
        package will be typing that name.
        And don't worry about collisions <i class="calibre12">a priori</i>.
        The package name is only the default name for imports; it need not be unique
        across all source code, and in the rare case of a collision the
        importing package can choose a different name to use locally.
        In any case, confusion is rare because the file name in the import
        determines just which package is being used.
      </p>

      <p class="calibre4">
        Another convention is that the package name is the base name of
        its source directory;
        the package in <code class="calibre6">src/encoding/base64</code>
        is imported as <code class="calibre6">"encoding/base64"</code> but has name <code
          class="calibre6">base64</code>,
        not <code class="calibre6">encoding_base64</code> and not <code class="calibre6">encodingBase64</code>.
      </p>

      <p class="calibre4">
        The importer of a package will use the name to refer to its contents,
        so exported names in the package can use that fact
        to avoid stutter.
        (Don't use the <code class="calibre6">import .</code> notation, which can simplify
        tests that must run outside the package they are testing, but should otherwise be avoided.)
        For instance, the buffered reader type in the <code class="calibre6">bufio</code> package is called <code
          class="calibre6">Reader</code>,
        not <code class="calibre6">BufReader</code>, because users see it as <code class="calibre6">bufio.Reader</code>,
        which is a clear, concise name.
        Moreover,
        because imported entities are always addressed with their package name, <code
          class="calibre6">bufio.Reader</code>
        does not conflict with <code class="calibre6">io.Reader</code>.
        Similarly, the function to make new instances of <code class="calibre6">ring.Ring</code>—which
        is the definition of a <em class="calibre12">constructor</em> in Go—would
        normally be called <code class="calibre6">NewRing</code>, but since
        <code class="calibre6">Ring</code> is the only type exported by the package, and since the
        package is called <code class="calibre6">ring</code>, it's called just <code class="calibre6">New</code>,
        which clients of the package see as <code class="calibre6">ring.New</code>.
        Use the package structure to help you choose good names.
      </p>

      <p class="calibre4">
        Another short example is <code class="calibre6">once.Do</code>;
        <code class="calibre6">once.Do(setup)</code> reads well and would not be improved by
        writing <code class="calibre6">once.DoOrWaitUntilDone(setup)</code>.
        Long names don't automatically make things more readable.
        A helpful doc comment can often be more valuable than an extra long name.
      </p>

      <h3 id="Getters" class="calibre5">Getters</h3>

      <p class="calibre4">
        Go doesn't provide automatic support for getters and setters.
        There's nothing wrong with providing getters and setters yourself,
        and it's often appropriate to do so, but it's neither idiomatic nor necessary
        to put <code class="calibre6">Get</code> into the getter's name. If you have a field called
        <code class="calibre6">owner</code> (lower case, unexported), the getter method should be
        called <code class="calibre6">Owner</code> (upper case, exported), not <code class="calibre6">GetOwner</code>.
        The use of upper-case names for export provides the hook to discriminate
        the field from the method.
        A setter function, if needed, will likely be called <code class="calibre6">SetOwner</code>.
        Both names read well in practice:
      </p>
      <pre class="calibre7">owner := obj.Owner()
if owner != user {
    obj.SetOwner(user)
}
</pre>

      <h3 id="interface-names" class="calibre5">Interface names</h3>

      <p class="calibre4">
        By convention, one-method interfaces are named by
        the method name plus an -er suffix or similar modification
        to construct an agent noun: <code class="calibre6">Reader</code>,
        <code class="calibre6">Writer</code>, <code class="calibre6">Formatter</code>,
        <code class="calibre6">CloseNotifier</code> etc.
      </p>

      <p class="calibre4">
        There are a number of such names and it's productive to honor them and the function
        names they capture.
        <code class="calibre6">Read</code>, <code class="calibre6">Write</code>, <code class="calibre6">Close</code>,
        <code class="calibre6">Flush</code>,
        <code class="calibre6">String</code> and so on have
        canonical signatures and meanings. To avoid confusion,
        don't give your method one of those names unless it
        has the same signature and meaning.
        Conversely, if your type implements a method with the
        same meaning as a method on a well-known type,
        give it the same name and signature;
        call your string-converter method <code class="calibre6">String</code> not <code
          class="calibre6">ToString</code>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="mixed-caps" class="calibre5">MixedCaps</h3>

      <p class="calibre4">
        Finally, the convention in Go is to use <code class="calibre6">MixedCaps</code>
        or <code class="calibre6">mixedCaps</code> rather than underscores to write
        multiword names.
