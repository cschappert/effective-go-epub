                Go provides C-style <code class="calibre6">/* */</code> block comments
                and C++-style <code class="calibre6">//</code> line comments.
                Line comments are the norm;
                block comments appear mostly as package comments, but
                are useful within an expression or to disable large swaths of code.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                The program—and web server—<code class="calibre6">godoc</code> processes
                Go source files to extract documentation about the contents of the
                package.
                Comments that appear before top-level declarations, with no intervening newlines,
                are extracted along with the declaration to serve as explanatory text for the item.
                The nature and style of these comments determines the
                quality of the documentation <code class="calibre6">godoc</code> produces.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                Every package should have a <i class="calibre12">package comment</i>, a block
                comment preceding the package clause.
                For multi-file packages, the package comment only needs to be
                present in one file, and any one will do.
                The package comment should introduce the package and
                provide information relevant to the package as a whole.
                It will appear first on the <code class="calibre6">godoc</code> page and
                should set up the detailed documentation that follows.
            </p>

Package regexp implements a simple library for regular expressions.

The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is:

    regexp:
        concatenation { '|' concatenation }
    concatenation:
        { closure }
    closure:
        term [ '*' | '+' | '?' ]
    term:
        '^'
        '$'
        '.'
        character
        '[' [ '^' ] character-ranges ']'
        '(' regexp ')'
*/
package regexp
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                If the package is simple, the package comment can be brief.

            <p class="calibre4">
                Comments do not need extra formatting such as banners of stars.
                The generated output may not even be presented in a fixed-width font, so don't depend
                on spacing for alignment—<code class="calibre6">godoc</code>, like <code class="calibre6">gofmt</code>,
                takes care of that.
                The comments are uninterpreted plain text, so HTML and other
                annotations such as <code class="calibre6">_this_</code> will reproduce <i
                    class="calibre12">verbatim</i> and should
                not be used.
                One adjustment <code class="calibre6">godoc</code> does do is to display indented
                text in a fixed-width font, suitable for program snippets.
                The package comment for the
                <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/" class="pcalibre calibre"><code class="calibre6">fmt</code>
                    package</a> uses this to good effect.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                Depending on the context, <code class="calibre6">godoc</code> might not even
                reformat comments, so make sure they look good straight up:
                use correct spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure,
                fold long lines, and so on.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                Inside a package, any comment immediately preceding a top-level declaration
                serves as a <i class="calibre12">doc comment</i> for that declaration.
                Every exported (capitalized) name in a program should
                have a doc comment.
            </p>

            <p class="calibre4">
                Doc comments work best as complete sentences, which allow
                a wide variety of automated presentations.
                The first sentence should be a one-sentence summary that
                starts with the name being declared.
            </p>

                If every doc comment begins with the name of the item it describes,
                you can use the <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Show_documentation_for_package_or_symbol"
                    class="pcalibre calibre">doc</a>
                subcommand of the <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/" class="pcalibre calibre">go</a> tool
                and run the output through <code class="calibre6">grep</code>.
                Imagine you couldn't remember the name "Compile" but were looking for
                the parsing function for regular expressions, so you ran
                the command,
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">$ go doc -all regexp | grep -i parse
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                If all the doc comments in the package began, "This function...", <code class="calibre6">grep</code>
                wouldn't help you remember the name. But because the package starts each
                doc comment with the name, you'd see something like this,
                which recalls the word you're looking for.
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">$ go doc -all regexp | grep -i parse

            <p class="calibre4">
                Go's declaration syntax allows grouping of declarations.
                A single doc comment can introduce a group of related constants or variables.
                Since the whole declaration is presented, such a comment can often be perfunctory.
            </p>

            <pre class="calibre7">// Error codes returned by failures to parse an expression.
var (
    ErrInternal      = errors.New("regexp: internal error")

    ...
)
</pre>

            <p class="calibre4">
                Grouping can also indicate relationships between items,
                such as the fact that a set of variables is protected by a mutex.
